You specify the values for the two parameters and then, you know everything there is to know about a random variable which is binomially distributed. The distribution models scenarios where we are interested in the cumulative outcome of successive Bernoulli trials - something like the number of heads in multiple coin flips or the number of passengers that arrive given three reservations. More formally, a binomially distributed random variable, let’s call it $X$, represents the number of successes in $n$ Bernoulli trials where each trial has success probability $p$. Thus, $n$ and $p$ are the two-parameters that need to be specified for a Binomial-distributed random variable."
